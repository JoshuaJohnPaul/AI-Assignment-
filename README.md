# Image Processing with OpenCV

This project demonstrates various image processing techniques using OpenCV in Python. The operations performed include reading and displaying images, converting images to grayscale, writing images to disk, resizing images, splitting and merging color channels, Region of Interest (ROI), image blurring, Gaussian blurring, and rotating images.
